# React Component Update Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue in React applications where a component fails to re-render when data from an asynchronous API call changes. The component correctly displays loading and error states, but the UI doesn't update when new data arrives.

## Bug Description:
The `MyComponent` fetches data from an API.  While loading and error states are handled correctly, the component doesn't re-render when new data is successfully fetched.  This leads to a stale UI.

## Solution:
The issue is likely caused by incorrect usage of the `useEffect` hook or missing dependency arrays. The solution provided addresses this by correctly managing the dependencies of the `useEffect` hook.
